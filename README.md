# Post-Surgery-Recovery-Tracker----Mini-Project
Project Details 
  • Title of the Project: Smart Post-Surgery Recovery Monitoring and Management System 

  • Project Domain/Area: Healthcare Technology with focus on Post-Operative Care Management 
    and AI-driven Patient Monitoring Systems 

  • Problem Statement & Objectives:  
    Post-surgery patients often face delays in receiving medical attention due to limited follow-up 
    mechanisms and unavailability of their primary doctor. This leads to complications going unnoticed 
    until they become severe. An AI-powered chatbot integrated into the hospital’s website can monitor 
    recovery progress, send health reports to the assigned or alternate doctor, and guide patients to the 
    nearest hospital during emergencies, ensuring timely and effective post-operative care. 

    • Monitor patient recovery remotely using an AI-powered chatbot to collect symptoms, vitals, 
      and post-operative feedback. 
    • Automate health report delivery to the primary surgeon or an alternate available doctor in the 
      same department based on doctor availability timings. 
    • Detect and respond to emergencies by providing real-time alerts and advising patients to  
      visit the nearest hospital. 
    • Enhance doctor–patient communication through a secure hospital website with separate 
      portals for doctors and patients. 
    • Reduce post-surgery complications by enabling timely medical intervention through  
      medication reminders and continuous follow-up. 

  • Proposed Technology/Tools:  
    Frontend - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, Bootstrap 
    Backend - Node.js, Express.js, Restful APIs 
    Database – MongoDB 
    Chatbot Tools – Rasa, DialogFlow, MakeAI 
    Notifications & Reminders - Firebase Cloud Messaging, EmailJS 

  • Brief Abstract (150-200 words): 
    Post-surgery recovery requires continuous monitoring to prevent complications and ensure timely 
    intervention. The Smart Post-Surgery Recovery Management System is a web-based platform with 
    separate portals for doctors and patients, integrated with an AI-powered chatbot. Patients can log 
    symptoms, vitals, and recovery progress, which are automatically analyzed and sent as reports to the 
    operating doctor or an alternate doctor in the same department if the primary is unavailable. In case 
    of emergencies, the system guides the patient to the nearest hospital and alerts medical staff. This 
    solution enhances patient safety, improves communication, and reduces the risk of post operative 
    complications through timely medical attention. Additional features include booking follow-up 
    appointments and receiving on-time medication reminders through the chatbot. By combining AI, 
    secure communication, and automated reporting, the system streamlines post-surgery care and 
    supports faster, safer patient recovery. 

  • Expected Outcome: 
    • A fully functional hospital website with separate doctor and patient login portals. 
    • AI chatbot capable of interacting with patients, collecting health data, and detecting 
      emergencies. 
    • Automatic generation and delivery of recovery reports to the concerned doctor or alternate 
      available doctor according to their availability timing. 
    • Secure storage of patient health records and chat history for future reference. 
    • Appointment booking system for follow-up consultations with the operating doctor. 
    • On-time medication remainders delivered by the chatbot.
